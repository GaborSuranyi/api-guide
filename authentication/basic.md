# Basic Authentication

The API supports Basic Authentication as defined in [RFC2617](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt) with a few slight differences.

Requests that require authentication will return `404 Not Found`, instead of `403 Forbidden`, in some places. This is to prevent the accidental leakage of private books to unauthorized users.

### Via Username and Password

To use Basic Authentication with the GitBook API, simply send the username and password associated with the account.

For example, if youâ€™re accessing the API via cURL, the following command would authenticate you if you replace <username> with your GitBook username. (cURL will prompt you to enter the password.)

```
$ curl -u <username> https://api.gitbook.com/account
```

### Via OAuth Tokens

Alternatively, you can use personal access tokens or OAuth tokens instead of your password.

```
$ curl -u <username>:<token> https://api.gitbook.com/account
```

This approach is useful if your tools only support Basic Authentication but you want to take advantage of OAuth access token security features.
